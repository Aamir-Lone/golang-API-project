1. Purpose of the Code (REST API Overview)
The code implements a REST API for managing To-Do tasks using MongoDB as the database. It allows a client (such as a web or mobile app) to perform the following CRUD operations:

Create a new To-Do task (POST)
Get a list of all To-Do tasks (GET)
Get details of a specific To-Do task by ID (GET)
Update an existing To-Do task by ID (PUT)
Delete a To-Do task by ID (DELETE)
2. Core Operations (REST Endpoints)
Here’s the corrected breakdown of the To-Do List REST API’s functionality:

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/tasks	Fetch a list of all To-Do tasks
GET	/tasks/{id}	Fetch a specific To-Do task by its MongoDB ID
POST	/tasks	Create a new To-Do task
PUT	/tasks/{id}	Update an existing To-Do task by its ID
DELETE	/tasks/{id}	Delete a To-Do task by its ID
3. Explanation of Each Code Component
Let me break down the files specific to the To-Do List API:

1. models.go (Models Layer)
This file defines the structure of a To-Do task and includes functions to interact with MongoDB.

To-Do Struct: This defines the shape of a task in the MongoDB database.
go
Copy code
type Todo struct {
	ID        primitive.ObjectID `json:"id,omitempty" bson:"_id,omitempty"`
	Task      string             `json:"task,omitempty" bson:"task,omitempty"`
	Completed bool               `json:"completed,omitempty" bson:"completed,omitempty"`
}
The fields include:

ID: A unique identifier for each task.

Task: The name or description of the task.

Completed: A boolean value indicating whether the task is done or not.

MongoDB Operations: Functions like Insert, Find, Update, and Delete are used to interact with MongoDB.

2. controller.go (Controller Layer)
The controller layer defines the logic for handling each HTTP request.

GetTasks (GET /tasks): Fetches all tasks from MongoDB.

GetTaskByID (GET /tasks/{id}): Fetches a specific task by its MongoDB Object ID.

CreateTask (POST /tasks): Takes data from the request body and creates a new task in MongoDB.

UpdateTask (PUT /tasks/{id}): Updates an existing task in MongoDB using the task’s ID.

DeleteTask (DELETE /tasks/{id}): Deletes a task from the database based on its ID.

3. router.go (Routing Layer)
This file maps the REST API’s endpoints to the appropriate controller functions.

For example:

go
Copy code
router.HandleFunc("/tasks", controller.GetTasks).Methods("GET")
router.HandleFunc("/tasks/{id}", controller.GetTaskByID).Methods("GET")
router.HandleFunc("/tasks", controller.CreateTask).Methods("POST")
router.HandleFunc("/tasks/{id}", controller.UpdateTask).Methods("PUT")
router.HandleFunc("/tasks/{id}", controller.DeleteTask).Methods("DELETE")
Each route is associated with a function in the controller that handles the request.

4. main.go (Main Entry Point)
This is the entry point of the application that initializes the server, sets up the MongoDB connection, and starts the API.

It creates the HTTP server and listens on a specific port (like localhost:8000).
The router is configured to handle API routes defined in router.go.
4. What REST API Does This Code Develop?
This code develops a To-Do List Management REST API. It provides CRUD functionality for managing tasks stored in MongoDB.

Create: Using the POST method, clients can add new tasks.
Read: Using the GET method, clients can fetch all tasks or a specific task by its ID.
Update: Using the PUT method, clients can modify a task (e.g., mark it as completed).
Delete: Using the DELETE method, clients can remove a task from the database.
5. Final Overview of Functionality
The REST API allows clients (e.g., front-end web apps, mobile apps) to interact with and manage To-Do tasks in MongoDB. It follows the stateless nature of REST, meaning each client request contains all the information needed to process the request, and no session is maintained between requests.
